## About
In Summer 2025, I decided to create a project in a attempt to create Cornell's own internal job site to replace Handshake, which many students dislike due to the lack of tailored opportunities and the high amounts of spam postings. Cracked @ Cornell was meant to be a job platform with human-vetted opportunities that were tailored to the various majors that Cornell had to offer. Soon realized that creating a three-way product is quite difficult (school, employer, student), but was able to create a working prototype. 

**Technologies**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Clerk Authentication, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
